	ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS
SyntaxErrors also known as parsing errors are perhaps the most common kind of   complaint you get while you are still learning python.

Exceptions:
Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an 	error when an attempt is made to execute it.

Exceptions are errors detected during execution and are not unconditionally fatal.
