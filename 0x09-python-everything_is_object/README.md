This project provides more insight on the idea that everything is an object.
It also teaches us about mutable and immutable types in python.
Immutable types are objects whose identity address can't be changed, like:
	Tuple
	Int
	Float
	strings

Mutable types are object whose identity address can be changed, like:
	lists
	Dictionary
	sets

It also teaches us about cloning, and i prefer the word cloning because of the ambiguity of the word copy.
It also states the difference between classes, objects and instances
